# Welcome to our World Happiness Report visualization!

The dataset we are working with was found on Kaggle.com, called the “World Happiness Report”. The data was collected through the Gallup World Poll. It has been collected annually since 2012, and we have access to data from 2015 to 2017.


This report has gained attention from experts in various fields across the world. It can be of interest to economists, psychologists, policymakers, and more. This data and any analysis of it could have a major effect on the prioritization of certain issues in a country by their leaders.


Each country has a corresponding happiness score (on a scale from 1 to 10), and the score is broken up into different values that make up different percentages of it. Each of the values we talk about will be presented as the percentage they make of overall happiness, not as individual values.

The data we used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).
